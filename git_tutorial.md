the three important commands in git are:
- `git add .` - this command stages all the changes in the current directory and its subdirectories for the next commit.
- `git commit -m "message"` - this command creates a new commit with the staged changes and a message describing the changes.
- `git push` - this command uploads the local commits to the remote repository, making them available to others.
